# City-Temperatures
This is a C project. The user inserts the temperature of 5 cities, and the program shows the national average temperature,
the average temp. of every city and the max deviation from the national avg temp.

When the .exe runs, the user will have to insert the temperatures(temp.) for 5 different cities. 
For every city, the user will insert 3 different temp. values: 1 for the hours 0-8, 1 for the 8-16 and 1 for the 16-24.

After that, there will be a message showing the national avg temp.
Beneath that, there will be a message for every city showing the city number, the city avg temp 
and the max deviation from the national avg temp.

In this project, the "genlib.h" & "simpio.h" from roberts libraries have been used.
